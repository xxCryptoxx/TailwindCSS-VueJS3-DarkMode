## About

### Why
I was looking everywhere for dark mode, specifically for VueJS 3 and TailwindCSS, but couldnt find it anywhere. I decided to do it myself. Hopefully this might help others.

### What
This is an example of dark mode integration, so users of a vue site can tap or click on a button that changes the theme(light to dark).
